# Snake AI Project

This project implements a Snake game with machine learning capabilities to train an AI agent to play the game. The AI will learn to make decisions based on the current state of the game and improve its performance over time.

## Project Structure

```

|
│── snake.py          # Main implementation of the Snake game
├── requirements.txt      # List of dependencies for the project
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd SnakeAI
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the Snake game, execute the following command:
```
python snake.py
```

## Project Goals

- Implement a functional Snake game using Pygame.
- Develop an AI agent that can learn to play the game using reinforcement learning techniques.
- Provide utility functions to assist with training and data processing.
