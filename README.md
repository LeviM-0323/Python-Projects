# Python Projects
A small collection of Python projects accumulated during my learning process

## Streamlit Tests
An even smaller collection of Streamlit web apps to learn the framework

In order to use Prompt Playground you'll need to provide your own OpenAI key. Duplicate .env-example and rename it to .env then replace the placeholder variable with your key and rerun the program.

## Maze Solver
Just a Tkinter GUI app that allows the user to generate a random maze with random start and end points, then solve the maze using different
solving algorithms. The app tracks how long each algorithm takes and how many nodes are visited.

## Voice Control
Meant to be a project allowing users to attempt to play DOOM using only their voice. Voice controls are very iffy at the moment and there are a lot of bugs that need fixing, but it does TECHNICALLY work.
You will have to change your controls in DOOM to be completely independant of the mouse, as this program doesn't use the mouse. Otherwise just run the program, run the game, and good luck.
